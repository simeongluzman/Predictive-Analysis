# JB-Hyperskill-Simulation

## current todo:

## 1. Decide how to encode your datacolumns - split between label and one-hot
## 2. Decide if any columns need to be stripped - check for columns with high proportions of NaN
## 3. split Data between training and test sets
## 4. Implement ML/regression/monte models
 
Initial Ideas for Cleaning Data:

    1. ONLY 14 USERS - LABEL 1-14
    2. Remove Co-Linear Columns - columns that depend on each other: 
        ex: 
    3.
